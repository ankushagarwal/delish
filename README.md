delish
======

Delicious is a very nice way to manage bookmarks on the World Wide Web. There is a feature in Delicious where it automatically suggests you tags for the links you bookmark. But most of the time, you want to automatically add the suggested tags to your bookmark. That is what delish does exactly. When you save a bookmark with Delicious, delish takes care of tagging it for you.
